                    Today, Tunisia is called upon to achieve intensive growth, based on the exploitation of technical progress, using technological advances in the various sectors of economic and industrial activities. The mastership of all technological advances and the improvement of the efficiencies of the various sectors cannot be carried out without the involvement of the engineer.<br>
                    The governorate of Sfax is renowned for its industrial frame of SMEs (more than 2,500 units employing more than 60,000 people), largely in industrial production. Industrial development, which is closely linked to the evolution of information technology, implies a need for formation in the field of engineering sciences and for reforms of teaching programs so that they are perfectly adequate with the evolution of this technology. It is therefore important that engineering formation must be adapted to best respond to these “new” roles that are now assigned to it.<br>
                    The engineering study program, in Industrial Computer Engineering (GII) of ENET'Com, is part of the objective of meeting the needs of industrial companies, working in the manufacturing sectors, in terms of high-level versatile executives in the fields of computer engineering and industrial computing. The choice of this program is justified by the fact that knowledge in the computer, electrical and automatic fields constitute a background, common to many functions that are increasingly necessary and demanded by the industrial sector. The latter is forced to integrate new information and industrial technologies, which requires on its part the recruitment of personnel specialized in these fields and able to integrate the constant mutation of technology.<br>
                    The industrial computer engineering study program was inspired by the need for business skills in this discipline established in the industrial fabric, considering the following criteria:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow students to integrate the job market considering the specificities of the regional and national industrial fabric (agri-food industries, petrochemicals, automated industrial systems, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Ensure easy legibility of the obtained diploma by manufacturers through positioning the proposed study program in relation to similar program in Tunisia by consulting Tunisian and foreign university professors.</li>
                        <li>Provide general training that reinforces the knowledge acquired during study in preparatory schools (DEUPC) or undergraduate degrees, to broaden and standardize the input, considering the essential skills that the engineer must have within of industry by mastering industrial engineering tools generally emanating from the EEAC field (electronics, electrical engineering, automation and computer science).</li>
                        <li>Computer science (programming, systems, networks, etc.) has invaded the industrial field. This component is present at all levels of study program to ensure a dual-dominant engineering degree.</li>
                        <li>Ensure a technological development by the presence, in the offered options, of teaching units in relation to current technological developments in information technology and artificial intelligence.</li>
                        <li>A groundbreaking proposal for a study program meeting the needs of specialized engineers for new projects planned for the region of Sfax and southern Tunisia (Energy and environment, manufacturing, resource, and data management, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Be attentive to the requirements of the current global market in terms of standardization and quality of services and products that we want to be reliable and competitive.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The fifth semester S5 of the program study is reserved for more specialized and in-depth courses in one of the three options assigned to students according to their choice and their order of merit. The offered options are adapted to the constant changes in technology and ensure a technological watch through the presence of teaching units in relation to current technological developments in information technology and artificial intelligence. These options are :<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Speciality 1 : Industrial Control and Robotics (ICR): </b>This option offers an integrated approach to engineering sciences adapted to the needs of the industry of the future 4.0, which corresponds to a new generation of factories that are connected, robotized and intelligent. The engineering student is trained in the design, development and implementation of systems control-command and supervision using automation and artificial intelligence tools. This option will also allow the student to acquire skills in IT development, cyber security and IoT deployment related to complex robotic and automated production systems.</li>
                        <li><b>Speciality 2 : Intelligent and  Interconnected Systems (SII): </b>This option aims to provide students with scientific knowledge and cutting-edge skills to enable them to design complete intelligent systems starting from data collection to the safety and security of the developed system. This option also aims to empower the most advanced industries through advanced interconnect technologies and processes such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Sensors, Robotics, Image Processing, deep learning, etc.</li>
                        <li><b>Speciality 3 : Supervision and Energy Systems (SSE): </b>This option is designed for engineering students motivated to meet the challenges facing society in the fields of energy production, storage and management used in the industrial sector and in home automation (building and smart networks). In this option, engineering students, through knowledge of computer engineering and electrical system control, discover alternative and conventional energy technologies, the societal and environmental impact of technological developments and the economic benefits of these developments.</li>
